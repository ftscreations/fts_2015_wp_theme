# Austria WP Theme

Austria is a single page WordPress theme developed by FTS Creations and inspired by Nikolay Talanov's [Codepen].

###Version
1.0

###Background
Wordpress needs more themes that use the latest CSS and HTML. This theme aims to do that. Some of the modern CSS it uses includes:
  - CSS Animations
  - SASS
  - SVGs

It also utilizes some lite jQuery for page animation and is built on the [10Up WP theme] template which uses Grunt.

###Installation

To install this theme download the theme from Git, put it in a folder in the themes folder and select it as active in the WP backend.

###Todo's
- Make mobile friendly (currently only displays well in browser and tablet)
- Implement more customization through the WP backend

###Development
Want to contribute? Great!

This theme uses Grunt for fast developing. Fork it, make your changes/bug fixes and I will merge them back in.
